    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Brian.
       \n\nI love chicken.
        \n\nThe kind that is alive full of energy running around in a big farm or a forest.
        \nFun fact is that I have big farm and a mini forest.
         \n\nI like eating chicken too. Fried chicken. Baked chicken. Grilled chicken. Poached chicken-not so much.
          \nAnd sometimes I even go for wild chicken hunting.
           \nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
            \n\nOnce, when I was camping in Brazil, and very hungry, I even caught a big wild rooster with my hands.
             \n\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to breed chicken.
              \nYou should ask someone else about wild chicken hunting though.\n\n</string>
